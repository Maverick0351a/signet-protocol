# Trust Fabric: The Signet Protocol Standard for Verified AI-to-AI Communications

## Executive Summary

The Signet Protocol establishes the **Trust Fabric** - a new standard for secure, auditable, and verifiable AI-to-AI communications. As autonomous agents become critical infrastructure, the need for cryptographic proof of interactions, semantic correctness, and regulatory compliance has never been greater.

**The Trust Fabric provides three core guarantees:**
1. **Verified Exchanges (VEx)** - Cryptographic proof that interactions occurred
2. **Signed Receipts** - Immutable audit trails with hash-chained integrity  
3. **HEL Egress Control** - Policy-enforced security for outbound communications

## The Problem: Trust in Autonomous Systems

### Current State
- AI agents operate without verification or audit trails
- No standardized way to prove interactions occurred
- Semantic corruption in LLM-mediated communications
- Regulatory compliance gaps in automated systems
- No cryptographic guarantees for business-critical AI workflows

### Business Impact
- **Financial Risk**: Unverified transactions and data transformations
- **Compliance Risk**: No audit trails for regulatory requirements
- **Security Risk**: Uncontrolled AI-to-AI communications
- **Trust Risk**: No way to verify AI agent behavior

## The Solution: Trust Fabric Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Verified Exchanges (VEx)
```
Every successful AI interaction generates exactly one VEx:
âœ… Authentication validated
âœ… Schema compliance verified  
âœ… Policy requirements met
âœ… Cryptographic receipt generated
```

#### 2. Signed Receipts (SR-1 Specification)
```json
{
  "trace_id": "conversation-chain-id",
  "hop": 1,
  "ts": "2025-01-27T12:00:00Z",
  "cid": "sha256:content-hash",
  "receipt_hash": "sha256:receipt-hash",
  "prev_receipt_hash": "sha256:previous-hash",
  "policy": {"engine": "HEL", "allowed": true},
  "signature": "ed25519-signature"
}
```

#### 3. HEL Egress Control
- **Host Explicit List (HEL)** policy engine
- IP pinning with SSRF protection
- Response size limiting
- DNS rebinding attack prevention

### Semantic Invariants System
Prevents LLM fallback corruption:
- **Amount Precision**: Monetary values cannot change significantly
- **Currency Stability**: Currency codes remain unchanged
- **ID Immutability**: Identifiers cannot be modified
- **Required Fields**: Critical fields cannot be removed

## Technical Specifications

### SR-1: Signet Receipt Standard
- **RFC 8785 JCS Canonicalization** for deterministic hashing
- **Ed25519 signatures** for cryptographic integrity
- **Hash-chained receipts** for tamper-evident audit trails
- **JWKS rotation** for key management

### SVX-1: Verified Exchange Semantics
- **Precise counting rules** for billing and SLA monitoring
- **Fallback Unit (FU) metering** for AI service consumption
- **Reserved capacity models** for enterprise billing
- **Idempotency guarantees** for reliable operations

## Adoption Strategy

### Phase 1: Framework Integration (One-Line Setup)

#### LangChain Integration
```python
from signet_callback import enable_signet_verification

# One line to enable verification
signet = enable_signet_verification(
    "https://signet.yourcompany.com", 
    "your-api-key"
)

chain.run(input, callbacks=[signet])
```

#### Plain HTTP Integration  
```python
from signet_client import verify_invoice

# One line to verify data
result = verify_invoice(
    "https://signet.yourcompany.com",
    "your-api-key", 
    invoice_data
)
```

#### JavaScript/Browser Integration
```javascript
import { verifyReceipt } from 'signet-verify';

// One line to verify receipts
const { valid, reason } = await verifyReceipt(receipt);
```
