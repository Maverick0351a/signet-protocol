# 🛡️ Signet Protocol - Compliance Control Matrix

## One-Page Enterprise Compliance Overview

**"Regulation is the forcing function. Across jurisdictions (EU AI Act, NIST RMF, sector rules), the message is uniform: prove identity, provenance, integrity, and keep tamper‑evident logs. That's exactly Signet."**

## 📋 RFP Response Template

**Q: How do you ensure AI system auditability and compliance?**

**A:** "Signet Protocol provides cryptographic auditability through hash-linked receipt chains with Ed25519 signatures. Every AI interaction generates immutable proof of identity, provenance, and integrity. Our SR-1 specification ensures standardized, verifiable audit trails that meet EU AI Act, NIST RMF, and sector-specific requirements. Auditors can verify complete interaction history in under 90 seconds using our verification SDKs."

**Q: What security controls prevent AI system compromise?**

**A:** "Our HEL (Host Egress List) policy engine provides zero-trust egress control with DNS→IP validation, preventing SSRF attacks and data exfiltration. Semantic invariants prevent AI output corruption, while tenant isolation ensures multi-customer security. All communications use HTTPS with IP pinning and response size limits."

**Q: How do you handle regulatory reporting and incident response?**

**A:** "Signet generates real-time compliance dashboards with 43+ metrics covering performance, security, and regulatory requirements. Export bundles provide complete audit trails for regulatory submission. Trace ID correlation enables sub-hour incident response with full interaction lineage."
